## GTA:SA Deathcounter

The Deathcounter automatically increases the number of deaths stored in the program when the player dies and allows you to write it to a textfile to overlay it in OBS.

Download `GTASA_Deathcounter.EXE` and execute. It should detect the game (if it's running) after a few seconds. You can freely edit the number of deaths, for example to set an initial amount if you've already counted without this program.

You can change the format that is output to the textfile, "$d" gets replaced with the number of deaths.

CheatEngine saves the settings in the Windows Registry (probably under "HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Cheat Engine/gtasa_deathcounter").
