==GTA:SA==
`GTASA.CT` contains a Lua Script with some useful functions and a list of not very well sorted memory addresses (usually for v1.0).

The Lua Script should mostly work for all versions. Just open it in CheatEngine and say "Yes" to running the included script. The `GTASA_Util.EXE` is a Standalone CheatEngine Trainer (so you don't need CheatEngine installed) of the script.

Once the script is loaded, a window should come up. Just click on "Attach to gta_sa.exe" to open the game process. You can choose to "Enable Auto Attach" to detect the game automatically.

Use the "Configure Output" tab to determine what is output on the "Output" tab (mostly just Duping Debug values right now).

You can choose to some activated values to file by enabling "Writing to file enabled". This can be useful if you want it to use as a text source in OBS to overlay it on a video.

To be able to toggle the ONMISSION variable, enable the appropriate checkbox on the Util tab.
