## GTA:SA
The `GTASA.CT` contains:

* A GTASA Utility with some useful features (a Lua script with a GUI), which should work for most GTASA versions
* A list of not very well sorted memory addresses, usually for v1.0

### Getting Started
To use the GTASA Utility, you can either open the `GTASA.CT` in CheatEngine and say "Yes" to running the included script, or run the `GTASA_Util.EXE`, which is a Standalone CheatEngine Trainer based on the script (so you don't need CheatEngine installed).

Once the script is loaded, a window should come up. Just click on "Attach to gta_sa.exe" to open the game process. You can choose to "Enable Auto Attach" to detect the game automatically.

### Usage
Use the "Configure Output" tab to determine what is output on the "Output" (50ms refresh interval) or "Output 2" (1000ms) tab.

You can choose to write some activated values to file by enabling "Writing to file enabled". This can be useful if you want to overlay the values on a video, for example by adding it as a text layer in OBS.

Some more features:

* To be able to toggle the ONMISSION variable, enable the appropriate checkbox on the Util tab.
* The "Player Vehicle" shows what vehicle the player is in or was last in. If this is anything other than a bike or empty, then it's an indiciation for the AI weapon accuracy being increased.
